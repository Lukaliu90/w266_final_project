       "\"We present our approach to the problem of how an agent, within an economic Multi-Agent System, can determine when it should behave strategically (i.e. learn and use models of other agents), and when it should act as a simple price-taker. We provide a framework for the incremental implementation of modeling capabilities in agents, and a description of the forms of knowledge required. The agents were implemented and different populations simulated in order to learn more about their behavior and the merits of using and learning agent models.

Agent tracking is one key capability required for intelligent interaction. It involves monitoring the observable actions of other agents and inferring their unobserved actions, plans, goals and behaviors. This article examines the implications of such an agent tracking capability for agent architectures. It specifically focuses on real-time and dynamic environments, where an intelligent agent is faced with the challenge of tracking the highly flexible mix of goal-driven and reactive behaviors of other agents, in real-time. The key implication is that an agent architecture needs to provide direct support for flexible and efficient reasoning about other agents' models. In this article, such support takes the form of an architectural capability to execute the other agent's models, enabling mental simulation of their behaviors. Other architectural requirements that follow include the capabilities for (pseudo-) simultaneous execution of multiple agent models, dynamic sharing and unsharing of multiple agent models and high bandwidth inter-model communication. We have implemented an agent architecture, an experimental variant of the Soar integrated architecture, that conforms to all of these requirements. Agents based on this architecture have been implemented to execute two different tasks in a real-time, dynamic, multi-agent domain. The article presents experimental results illustrating the agents' dynamic behavior.|||||I. Introduction, 488. — II. The model with automobiles as an example, 489. — III.

Productive research in AI, both practical and theoretical, benefits from a notion of intelligence that is precise enough to allow the cumulative development of robust systems and general results. This paper outlines a gradual evolution in our formal conception of intelligence that brings it closer to our informal conception and simultaneously reduces the gap between theory and practice.\""

Most of the work in MAS also fails to recognize the possible gains from using explicit agent models to predict agent actions. @cite is an exception and gives another approach for using nested agent models. However, they do not go so far as to try to quantify the advantages of their nested models or show how these could be learned via observations. We believe that our research will bring to the foreground some of the common observations seen in these research areas and help to clarify the implications and utility of learning and using nested agent models.'"

For large maps, the performance of pure image matching techniques decays in terms of robustness and computational cost. Particularly, repeated occurrences of similar features due to repeating structure in the world (e.g., doorways, chairs, etc.) or missing associations between observations pose critical challenges to visual localization. We address these challenges using a two-step approach. We first estimate a candidate pose using few correspondences between features of the current camera frame and the feature map. The initial set of correspondences is established by proximity in feature space. The initial pose estimate is used in the second step to guide spatial matching of features in 3D, i.e., searching for associations where the image features are expected to be found in the map. A RANSAC algorithm is used to compute a fine estimation of the pose from the correspondences. Our approach clearly outperforms localization based on feature matching exclusively in feature space, both in terms of estimation accuracy and robustness to failure and allows for global localization in real time (30Hz).'"

Recent technological advances in this area have introduced affordable RGB-D devices in the robotics community. In this paper, we present a real-time technique for 6-DoF camera pose estimation through the incremental registration of RGB-D images. First, a set of edge features are computed from the depth and color images. An initial motion estimation is calculated through aligning the features. This initial guess is refined by applying the Iterative Closest Point algorithm on the dense point cloud data. A rigorous error analysis assesses several sets of RGB-D ground truth data via an error accumulation metric. We show that the proposed two-stage approach significantly reduces error in the pose estimation, compared to a state-of-the-art ICP registration technique.',\n",
       "  \"The authors describe a general-purpose, representation-independent method for the accurate and computationally efficient registration of 3-D shapes including free-form curves and surfaces. The method handles the full six degrees of freedom and is based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which requires only a procedure to find the closest point on a geometric entity to a given point. The ICP algorithm always converges monotonically to the nearest local minimum of a mean-square distance metric, and the rate of convergence is rapid during the first few iterations. Therefore, given an adequate set of initial rotations and translations for a particular class of objects with a certain level of 'shape complexity', one can globally minimize the mean-square distance metric over all six degrees of freedom by testing each initial registration. One important application of this method is to register sensed data from unfixtured rigid objects with an ideal geometric model, prior to shape inspection. Experimental results show the capabilities of the registration algorithm on point sets, curves, and surfaces. >\",\n",

To this end we propose an energy function which aims at finding the best rigid body motion to map one RGB-D image into another one, assuming a static scene filmed by a moving camera. We then propose a linearization of the energy function which leads to a 6×6 normal equation for the twist coordinates representing the rigid body motion. To allow for larger motions, we solve this equation in a coarse-to-fine scheme. Extensive quantitative analysis on recently proposed benchmark datasets shows that the proposed solution is faster than a state-of-the-art implementation of the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm by two orders of magnitude. While ICP is more robust to large camera motion, the proposed method gives better results in the regime of small displacements which are often the case in camera tracking applications.',\n",

In contrast to traditional approaches, our technique is not based on image features and does not require correspondences to be generated between frames of data. Instead, consecutive functions are correlated using spherical harmonic analysis. An Extended Gaussian Image (EGI), created from the local normal estimates of a point cloud, defines each function. Correlations are efficiently computed using Fourier transformations, resulting in a 3 Degree of Freedom (3-DoF) rotation estimate. An Iterative Closest Point (ICP) process then refines the initial rotation estimate and adds a translational component, yielding a full 6-DoF egomotion estimate. The focus of this work is to investigate the merits of using spherical harmonic analysis for egomotion estimation by comparison with alternative 6-DoF methods. We compare the performance of the proposed technique with that of stand-alone ICP and image feature based methods. As with other egomotion techniques, estimation errors accumulate and degrade results, necessitating correction mechanisms for robust localization. For this report, however, we use the raw estimates; no filtering or smoothing processes are applied. In-house and external benchmark data sets are analyzed for both runtime and accuracy.

       "\"We present our approach to the problem of how an agent, within an economic Multi-Agent System, can determine when it should behave strategically (i.e. learn and use models of other agents), and when it should act as a simple price-taker. We provide a framework for the incremental implementation of modeling capabilities in agents, and a description of the forms of knowledge required. The agents were implemented and different populations simulated in order to learn more about their behavior and the merits of using and learning agent models. Our results show, among other lessons, how savvy buyers can avoid being cheated'' by sellers, how price volatility can be used to quantitatively predict the benefits of deeper models, and how specific types of agent populations influence system behavior.|||||In multi-agent environments, an intelligent agent often needs to interact with other individuals or groups of agents to achieve its goals. Agent tracking is one key capability required for intelligent interaction. It involves monitoring the observable actions of other agents and inferring their unobserved actions, plans, goals and behaviors. This article examines the implications of such an agent tracking capability for agent architectures. It specifically focuses on real-time and dynamic environments, where an intelligent agent is faced with the challenge of tracking the highly flexible mix of goal-driven and reactive behaviors of other agents, in real-time. The key implication is that an agent architecture needs to provide direct support for flexible and efficient reasoning about other agents' models. In this article, such support takes the form of an architectural capability to execute the other agent's models, enabling mental simulation of their behaviors. Other architectural requirements that follow include the capabilities for (pseudo-) simultaneous execution of multiple agent models, dynamic sharing and unsharing of multiple agent models and high bandwidth inter-model communication. We have implemented an agent architecture, an experimental variant of the Soar integrated architecture, that conforms to all of these requirements. Agents based on this architecture have been implemented to execute two different tasks in a real-time, dynamic, multi-agent domain. The article presents experimental results illustrating the agents' dynamic behavior.|||||I. Introduction, 488. — II. The model with automobiles as an example, 489. — III. Examples and applications, 492. — IV. Counteracting institutions, 499. — V. Conclusion, 500.|||||The long-term goal of our field is the creation and understanding of intelligence. Productive research in AI, both practical and theoretical, benefits from a notion of intelligence that is precise enough to allow the cumulative development of robust systems and general results. This paper outlines a gradual evolution in our formal conception of intelligence that brings it closer to our informal conception and simultaneously reduces the gap between theory and practice.\""

       "['Data-driven algorithms have surpassed traditional techniques in almost every aspect in robotic vision problems. Such algorithms need vast amounts of quality data to be able to work properly after their training process. Gathering and annotating that sheer amount of data in the real world is a time-consuming and error-prone task. Those problems limit scale and quality. Synthetic data generation has become increasingly popular since it is faster to generate and automatic to annotate. However, most of the current datasets and environments lack realism, interactions, and details from the real world. UnrealROX is an environment built over Unreal Engine 4 which aims to reduce that reality gap by leveraging hyperrealistic indoor scenes that are explored by robot agents which also interact with objects in a visually realistic manner in that simulated world. Photorealistic scenes and robots are rendered by Unreal Engine into a virtual reality headset which captures gaze so that a human operator can move the robot and use controllers for the robotic hands; scene information is dumped on a per-frame basis so that it can be reproduced offline to generate raw data and ground truth annotations. This virtual reality environment enables robotic vision researchers to generate realistic and visually plausible data with full ground truth for a wide variety of problems such as class and instance semantic segmentation, object detection, depth estimation, visual grasping, and navigation.',\n",
       " 'UnrealCV is a project to help computer vision researchers build virtual worlds using Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). It extends UE4 with a plugin by providing (1) A set of UnrealCV commands to interact with the virtual world. (2) Communication between UE4 and an external program, such as Caffe. UnrealCV can be used in two ways. The first one is using a compiled game binary with UnrealCV embedded. This is as simple as running a game, no knowledge of Unreal Engine is required. The second is installing UnrealCV plugin to Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) and use the editor of UE4 to build a new virtual world. UnrealCV is an open-source software under the MIT license. Since the initial release in September 2016, it has gathered an active community of users, including students and researchers.',\n",
       " 'Several RGB-D datasets have been publicized over the past few years for facilitating research in computer vision and robotics. However, the lack of comprehensive and fine-grained annotation in these RGB-D datasets has posed challenges to their widespread usage. In this paper, we introduce SceneNN, an RGB-D scene dataset consisting of 100 scenes. All scenes are reconstructed into triangle meshes and have per-vertex and per-pixel annotation. We further enriched the dataset with fine-grained information such as axis-aligned bounding boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and object poses.

Unlike conventional approaches that combine deep learning and synthetic imagery, we propose an approach that does not need any external shape dataset to render synthetic images. Our approach consists of two synergistic processes: the evolution of complex shapes from simple primitives, and the training of a deep network for shape-from-shading. The evolution generates better shapes guided by the network training, while the training improves by using the evolved shapes. We show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on a shape-from-shading benchmark.',\n",

As a result, optical flow data sets are restricted in terms of size, complexity, and diversity, making optical flow algorithms difficult to train and test on realistic data. We introduce a new optical flow data set derived from the open source 3D animated short film Sintel. This data set has important features not present in the popular Middlebury flow evaluation: long sequences, large motions, specular reflections, motion blur, defocus blur, and atmospheric effects. Because the graphics data that generated the movie is open source, we are able to render scenes under conditions of varying complexity to evaluate where existing flow algorithms fail. We evaluate several recent optical flow algorithms and find that current highly-ranked methods on the Middlebury evaluation have difficulty with this more complex data set suggesting further research on optical flow estimation is needed. To validate the use of synthetic data, we compare the image- and flow-statistics of Sintel to those of real films and videos and show that they are similar. The data set, metrics, and evaluation website are publicly available.',\n",

Unfortunately, creating large datasets with pixel-level labels has been extremely costly due to the amount of human effort required. In this paper, we present an approach to rapidly creating pixel-accurate semantic label maps for images extracted from modern computer games. Although the source code and the internal operation of commercial games are inaccessible, we show that associations between image patches can be reconstructed from the communication between the game and the graphics hardware. This enables rapid propagation of semantic labels within and across images synthesized by the game, with no access to the source code or the content. We validate the presented approach by producing dense pixel-level semantic annotations for 25 thousand images synthesized by a photorealistic open-world computer game. Experiments on semantic segmentation datasets show that using the acquired data to supplement real-world images significantly increases accuracy and that the acquired data enables reducing the amount of hand-labeled real-world data: models trained with game data and just ( 1 3 ) of the CamVid training set outperform models trained on the complete CamVid training set.',\n",

In such environments, one can evaluate and improve a crucial property of practical intelligent systems, namely generalization.

With an emphasis on semantic-level generalization, we study the task of concept-driven navigation, RoomNav, using a subset of houses in House3D. In RoomNav, an agent navigates towards a target specified by a semantic concept. To succeed, the agent learns to comprehend the scene it lives in by developing perception, understand the concept by mapping it to the correct semantics, and navigate to the target by obeying the underlying physical rules. We train RL agents with both continuous and discrete action spaces and show their ability to generalize in new unseen environments. In particular, we observe that (1) training is substantially harder on large house sets but results in better generalization, (2) using semantic signals (e.g., segmentation mask) boosts the generalization performance, and (3) gated networks on semantic input signal lead to improved training performance and generalization.

Our key insight is to leverage the rich discriminative information provided by the scale variation of local geometric structures to constrain the massive search space of potential correspondences between model and scene points. In particular, we exploit the geometric scale variability in the form of the intrinsic geometric scale of each computed feature, the hierarchy induced within the set of these intrinsic geometric scales, and the discriminative power of the local scale-dependent invariant 3D shape descriptors. The method exploits the added information in a hierarchical coarse-to-fine manner that lets it cull the space of all potential correspondences effectively.

       " 'Few systems capable of recognizing complex objects with free-form (sculptured) surfaces have been developed. The apparent lack of success is mainly due to the lack of a competent modelling scheme for representing such complex objects. In this paper, a new form of point representation for describing 3D free-form surfaces is proposed. This representation, which we call the point signature, serves to describe the structural neighbourhood of a point in a more complete manner than just using the 3D coordinates of the point. Being invariant to rotation and translation, the point signature can be used directly to hypothesize the correspondence to model points with similar signatures. Recognition is achieved by matching the signatures of data points representing the sensed surface to the signatures of data points representing the model surface. The use of point signatures is not restricted to the recognition of a single-object scene to a small library of models. Instead, it can be extended naturally to the recognition of scenes containing multiple partially-overlapping objects (which may also be juxtaposed with each other) against a large model library. No preliminary phase of segmenting the scene into the component objects is required. In searching for the appropriate candidate model, recognition need not proceed in a linear order which can become prohibitive for a large model library. For a given scene, signatures are extracted at arbitrarily spaced seed points. Each of these signatures is used to vote for models that contain points having similar signatures. Inappropriate models with low votes can be rejected while the remaining candidate models are ordered according to the votes they received. In this way, efficient verification of the hypothesized candidates can proceed by testing the most likely model first. Experiments using real data obtained from a range finder have shown fast recognition from a library of fifteen models whose complexities vary from that of simple piecewise quadric shapes to complicated face masks.

       " 'Current systems for scene understanding typically represent objects as 2D or 3D bounding boxes. While these representations have proven robust in a variety of applications, they provide only coarse approximations to the true 2D and 3D extent of objects. As a result, object-object interactions, such as occlusions or ground-plane contact, can be represented only superficially. In this paper, we approach the problem of scene understanding from the perspective of 3D shape modeling, and design a 3D scene representation that reasons jointly about the 3D shape of multiple objects. This representation allows to express 3D geometry and occlusion on the fine detail level of individual vertices of 3D wireframe models, and makes it possible to treat dependencies between objects, such as occlusion reasoning, in a deterministic way. In our experiments, we demonstrate the benefit of jointly estimating the 3D shape of multiple objects in a scene over working with coarse boxes, on the recently proposed KITTI dataset of realistic street scenes.',\n",

A robust convolutional network is introduced for simultaneous vehicle detection, part localization, visibility characterization and 3D dimension estimation. Its architecture is based on a new coarse-to-fine object proposal that boosts the vehicle detection. Moreover, the Deep MANTA network is able to localize vehicle parts even if these parts are not visible. In the inference, the networks outputs are used by a real time robust pose estimation algorithm for fine orientation estimation and 3D vehicle localization. We show in experiments that our method outperforms monocular state-of-the-art approaches on vehicle detection, orientation and 3D location tasks on the very challenging KITTI benchmark.']"

       "['A spanner of an undirected unweighted graph is a subgraph that approximates the distance metric of the original graph with some specified accuracy. Specifically, we say H ⊆ G is an f-spanner of G if any two vertices u,v at distance d in G are at distance at most f(d) in H. There is clearly some trade-off between the sparsity of H and the distortion function f, though the nature of the optimal trade-off is still poorly understood. In this article we present a simple, modular framework for constructing sparse spanners that is based on interchangable components called connection schemes. By assembling connection schemes in different ways we can recreate the additive 2- and 6-spanners of [1999] and [2009], and give spanners whose multiplicative distortion quickly tends toward 1. Our results rival the simplicity of all previous algorithms and provide substantial improvements (up to a doubly exponential reduction in edge density) over the comparable spanners of Elkin and Peleg [2004] and Thorup and Zwick [2006].',\n",
       " 'An (α, β)-spanner of an unweighted graph G is a subgraph H that distorts distances in G up to a multiplicative factor of α and an additive term β. It is well known that any graph contains a (multiplicative) (2k−1, 0)-spanner of size O(n1+1 k) and an (additive) (1,2)-spanner of size O(n3 2). However no other additive spanners are known to exist. In this article we develop a couple of new techniques for constructing (α, β)-spanners. Our first result is an additive (1,6)-spanner of size O(n4 3). The construction algorithm can be understood as an economical agent that assigns costs and values to paths in the graph, purchasing affordable paths and ignoring expensive ones, which are intuitively well approximated by paths already purchased. We show that this path buying algorithm can be parameterized in different ways to yield other sparseness-distortion tradeoffs. Our second result addresses the problem of which (α, β)-spanners can be computed efficiently, ideally in linear time. We show that, for any k, a (k,k−1)-spanner with size O(kn1+1 k) can be found in linear time, and, further, that in a distributed network the algorithm terminates in a constant number of rounds. Previous spanner constructions with similar performance had roughly twice the multiplicative distortion.',\n",
       " \"For an unweighted undirected graph G= (V,E), and a pair of positive integers α ≥ 1, β ≥ 0, a subgraph G'= (V,H), H ⊆ E, is called an (α,β)-spanner of G if for every pair of vertices u, v ∈ V, dist G' (u,v) ≤ α • dist G' (u,v) + β.It was shown in [20] that for any e > 0, κ = 1,2, ..., there exists an integer β = β(e,κ) such that for every n-vertex graph G there exists a (1+e,β)-spanner G' with O(n1+1 κ) edges. An efficient distributed protocol for constructing (1+e,β)-spanners was devised in [18]. The running time and the communication complexity of that protocol are O(n1+ρ) and O(|E|nρ), respectively, where ρ is an additional control parameter of the protocol that affects only the additive term β.In this paper we devise a protocol with a drastically improved running time (O(nρ) as opposed to (O(n1+ρ) for constructing (1+e,β)-spanners. Our protocol has the same communication complexity as the protocol of [18], and it constructs spanners with essentially the same properties as the spanners that are constructed by the protocol of [18].We also show that our protocol for constructing (1+e, β)-spanners can be adapted to the streaming model, and devise a streaming algorithm that uses a constant number of passes and O(n1+1 κ • log n) bits of space for computing all-pairs-almost-shortest-paths of length at most by a multiplicative factor (1 + e) and an additive term of β greater than the shortest paths. Our algorithm processes each edge in time O(nρ), for an arbitrarily small ρ > 0. The only previously known algorithm for the problem [21] constructs paths of length κ times greater than the shortest paths, has the same space requirements as our algorithm, but requires O(n1+1 κ) time for processing each edge of the input graph. However, the algorithm of [21] uses just one pass over the input, as opposed to the constant number of passes in our algorithm. We also show that any streaming algorithm for o(n)-approximate distance computation requires Ω(n) bits of space.\",\n",
       " 'A spanner is a sparse subgraph that approximately preserves the pairwise distances of the original graph. It is well known that there is a smooth tradeoff between the sparsity of a spanner and the quality of its approximation, so long as distance error is measured multiplicatively. A central open question in the field is to prove or disprove whether such a tradeoff exists also in the regime of additive error. That is, is it true that for all e>0, there is a constant ke such that every graph has a spanner on O(n1+e) edges that preserves its pairwise distances up to +ke? Previous lower bounds are consistent with a positive resolution to this question, while previous upper bounds exhibit the beginning of a tradeoff curve: all graphs have +2 spanners on O(n3 2) edges, +4 spanners on O(n7 5) edges, and +6 spanners on O(n4 3) edges. However, progress has mysteriously halted at the n4 3 bound, and despite significant effort from the community, the question has remained open for all 0 Our main result is a surprising negative resolution of the open question, even in a highly generalized setting. We show a new information theoretic incompressibility bound: there is no function that compresses graphs into O(n4 3 − e) bits so that distance information can be recovered within +no(1) error. As a special case of our theorem, we get a tight lower bound on the sparsity of additive spanners: the +6 spanner on O(n4 3) edges cannot be improved in the exponent, even if any subpolynomial amount of additive error is allowed. Our theorem implies new lower bounds for related objects as well; for example, the twenty-year-old +4 emulator on O(n4 3) edges also cannot be improved in the exponent unless the error allowance is polynomial. Central to our construction is a new type of graph product, which we call the Obstacle Product. Intuitively, it takes two graphs G,H and produces a new graph G H whose shortest paths structure looks locally like H but globally like G.',\n",

This construction fills in the gap between the two existing constructions for purely additive spanners, one for 2-additive spanner of size O(n3 2) and the other for 6-additive spanner of size O(n4 3), and thus answers a main open question in this area. In addition, we present a construction for additive spanners with O(n1+δ) edges and additive stretch of O(n1 2−3δ 2) for any 3 17 ≤ δ < 1 3, improving the stretch of the existing constructions from O(n1−3δ) to O(√n1−3δ).

       " 'An additive spanner of an unweighted undirected graph G with distortion d is a subgraph H such that for any two vertices u, v G, we have _H ( u,v ) = _G ( u,v ) + d. For every k = O ( n n ), we construct a graph G on n vertices for which any additive spanner of G with distortion 2k - 1 has ( 1 k n^ 1 + 1 k ) edges. This matches the lower bound previously known only to hold under a 1963 conjecture of Erdos. We generalize our lower bound in a number of ways. First, we consider graph emulators introduced by Dor, Halperin, and Zwick (FOCS, 1996), where an emulator of an unweighted undirected graph G with distortion d is like an additive spanner except H may be an arbitrary weighted graph such that _G ( u,v ) _H ( u,v ) _G ( u,v ) + d. We show a lower bound of ( 1 k^2 n^ 1 + 1 k ) edges for distortion-(2k - 1) emulators. These are the first non-trivial bounds for k 3. Second, we parameterize our bounds in terms of the minimum degree of the graph. Namely, for minimum degree n^ 1 k+c for any c 0, we prove a bound of ( 1 k n^ 1 + 1 k - c(1 + 2 (k - 1)) ) for additive spanners and ( 1 k^2 n^ 1 + 1 k - c(1 + 2 (k - 1)) ) for emulators. For k = 2 these can be improved to ( n^ 3 2 - c ). This partially answers a question of (SODA, 2005) for additive spanners. Finally, we continue the study of pair-wise and source-wise distance preservers defined by Coppersmith and Elkin (SODA, 2005) by considering their approximate variants and their relaxation to emulators. We prove the first lower bounds for such graphs.',\n",
       " 'In the recent past, there has been considerable progress in devising algorithms for the all-pairs shortest paths (APSP) problem running in time significantly smaller than the obvious time bound of O(n3). Unfortunately, all the new algorithms are based on fast matrix multiplication algorithms that are notoriously impractical. Our work is motivated by the goal of devising purely combinatorial algorithms that match these improved running times. Our results come close to achieving this goal, in that we present algorithms with a small additive error in the length of the paths obtained. Our algorithms are easy to implement, have the desired property of being combinatorial in nature, and the hidden constants in the running time bound are fairly small. Our main result is an algorithm which solves the APSP problem in unweighted, undirected graphs with an additive error of 2 in time @math . This algorithm returns actual paths and not just the distances. In addition, we give more efficient algorithms with running time @math for the case where we are only required to determine shortest paths between k specified pairs of vertices rather than all pairs of vertices. The starting point for all our results is an @math algorithm for distinguishing between graphs of diameter 2 and 4, and this is later extended to obtaining a ratio 2 3 approximation to the diameter in time @math . Unlike in the case of APSP, our results for approximate diameter computation can be extended to the case of directed graphs with arbitrary positive real weights on the edges.',\n",
       " 'Shortest paths computations constitute one of the most fundamental network problems. Nonetheless, known parallel shortest-paths algorithms are generally inefficient: they perform significantly more work (product of time and processors) than their sequential counterparts.

       " 'A spanner is a sparse subgraph of a given graph that preserves approximate distance between each pair of vertices. In precise words, a t-spanner of a graph G = (V,E), for any t ∈ N, is a subgraph (V,ES), ES ⊆ E such that, for any u, v ∈ V , their distance in the subgraph is at most t times their distance in the original graph. The parameter t is called the stretch associated with the t-spanner. The concept of spanner was defined formally by Peleg and Schaffer [13] though the associated notion was used implicitly by Awerbuch [3] in the context of network synchronizers. Computing tspanner of smallest size for a given graph is a well motivated combinatorial problem with numerous applications in the area of distributed systems, communication networks and all pairs approximate shortest paths (see [4, 13] and references therein). However, computing t-spanner of smallest size for a graph is NP-hard. In fact, for t > 2, it is NP-hard [6] even to approximate the smallest size of t-spanner of a graph with ratio O(2(1−μ) lnn) for any μ > 0. Having realized this fact, researchers have pursued another direction : to design an efficient algorithm which, for a given graph on n vertices, outputs a t-spanner whose size is of the order of the maximum size of the sparsest tspanner of a graph on n vertices. A 43 years old girth lower bound conjecture by Erdős [7] implies that there are graphs on n vertices whose 2k as well as (2k− 1)spanner will requireΩ(n1+1 k) edges. This conjecture',\n",

       " 'We investigate the importance of space when solving problems based on graph distance in the streaming model. In this model, the input graph is presented as a stream of edges in an arbitrary order. The main computational restriction of the model is that we have limited space and therefore cannot store all the streamed data; we are forced to make space-efficient summaries of the data as we go along. For a graph of n vertices and m edges, we show that testing many graph properties, including connectivity (ergo any reasonable decision problem about distances) and bipartiteness, requires Ω(n) bits of space. Given this, we then investigate how the power of the model increases as we relax our space restriction. Our main result is an efficient randomized algorithm that constructs a (2t + 1)-spanner in one pass. With high probability, it uses O(t .n1+1 t log2n) bits of space and processes each edge in the stream in O(t2·n1 t log n) time. We find approximations to diameter and girth via the constructed spanner. For t = Ω(log n log log n), the space requirement of the algorithm is O(n .polylog n), and the per-edge processing time is O(polylog n). We also show a corresponding lower bound of t for the approximation ratio achievable when the space restriction is O(t.n1+1 t log2n).We then consider the scenario in which we are allowed multiple passes over the input stream. Here, we investigate whether allowing these extra passes will compensate for a given space restriction. We show that finding vertices at distance d from a particular vertex will always take d passes, for all d ∈ 1,...,t 2 , when the space restriction is o(n1+1 t). For girth, we show the existence of a direct trade-off between space and passes in the form of a lower bound on the product of the space requirement and number of passes. Finally, we conclude with two general techniques for speeding up the per-edge computation time of streaming algorithms while increasing the space by at most a log factor.',\n",

Our first result is a fast distributed algorithm for finding an ( O(2^ log ^ * n log n) ) -spanner with size O(n). Besides being nearly optimal in time and distortion, this algorithm appears to be the first that constructs an O(n)-size skeleton without requiring unbounded length messages or time proportional to the diameter of the network.

At their sparsest Fibonacci spanners can have nearly linear size, namely ( O(n( n)^ ) ) , where ( = (1 + 5 ) 2 ) is the golden ratio. As the distance increases the multiplicative distortion of a Fibonacci spanner passes through four discrete stages, moving from logarithmic to log-logarithmic, then into a period where it is constant, tending to 3, followed by another period tending to 1. On the lower bound side we prove that many recent sequential spanner constructions have no efficient counterparts in distributed networks, even if the desired distortion only needs to be achieved on the average or for a tiny fraction of the vertices.

       "'提案手法では、パターンを投影するため、これを除去したり、これを使ったセグメンテーションを行う。 セグメンテーションはSegNetやUnetがポピュラーであり、我々もこれを使う。 パターン除去には、GANによるインペインティングが有効と思われるが[11]、生成的アプローチは解像度が低いので今回は 使用しない。そこで、パターンをノイズと考え除去する。 CNNによるノイズの除去としては、Deepなアーキテクチャではなく訓練が簡単なResidualを用いることで、 訓練しやすいアーキテクチャである、ResBlockが提案された[8]。 このResBlockを用いて、反射除去のためにCEILNetというアーキテクチャも提案されている[9]。 さらに、WIN5RBネットワークを用いてEnd-to-Endでより効率よくノイズ除去する手法も提案されている[7]。 本研究ではこの[7]を用いてあぶく除去を行っているが、学習データの取得方法にオリジナリティがある。 CNNs are also popular in the field of image restoration and segmentation. In underwater environment, there are several noises, such as bubbles or shadows of water surfaces. In addition, projected pattern onto the target object is also a severe noise. To remove such a large noise, inpainting method based on a GAN is promising @cite @cite . However, since resolution of generative approaches are basically low, noise removal approach is better fit to our purpose. For efficient noise removal, shallow CNN-based approach using residual is proposed @cite . The technique is also extended to remove reflection @cite . Liu and Fang propose an end-to-end architecture using the WIN5RB network @cite which outperform others. We also use this technique, but data collection and multi-scale extension is novel. Liao al @cite denoised depth images both using depth image and RGB image. Zhang al @cite denoised images with CNNs with different noise levels taken into account. Choi al @cite proposed denoising with multi-scales with light-weight computation. Nakamura al @cite removed texts in natural scene images using multi-layers of convolutions and deconvolutions.'"

The existence of finite-time blowup for energy-critical wave maps into the two-sphere has first been observed numerically in the work of Bizo \\'n-Chmaj-Tabor @cite . Rigorously, the existence of blowup solutions was proved by Krieger-Schlag-Tataru @cite , Rodnianski-Sterbenz @cite , and Rapha \"el-Rodnianski @cite , see also @cite @cite .
